## How to contribute to GreenMail

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/greenmail-mail-test/greenmail/issues).
  Comments on existing issues are welcome, as it helps to see the impact and prioritize.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/greenmail-mail-test/greenmail/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Include a test demonstrating issue (and working fix) or feature

* Be concise, and keep the patch focused on the problem. Avoid cosmetic changes (reformatting, changing style, ...).

* Avoid new, additional dependencies to keep GreenMail lean.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* Changes of cosmetic nature do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of GreenMail will generally not be accepted.
  The [Ruby on Rails team](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700) has a good summary on the rationales behind this.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change as a new [Issues](https://github.com/greenmail-mail-test/greenmail/issues) for discussion.

* Beware of backward compatibility

GreenMail is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and appreciate contributions!
